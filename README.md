# Nurse Patient Assignment 

## Overview
A Python-based solution to suggest nurse-patient assignments for the next shift based on:
- Nurse availability and capacity.
- Patient bed assignments.
- Patient complexity of care.
- Previous assignment consistency.
- Room availability.
- Distance between nurses and patient rooms.

## Features
- Assigns nurses to patients and rooms while respecting complexity and capacity constraints.
- Prioritizes continuity of care.
- Generates optimal schedules using Google OR-Tools.

## Project Structure

├── data/               # Input data for nurses, patients, and history
├── scheduler/          # Core scheduling logic

```

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
   ```

2. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
   python interface/cli.py
   ```

3. View the generated schedule in the console.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OR-Tools
